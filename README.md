# Project Overview

**Title:**  
A Comprehensive Analysis and Machine Learning Prediction of Life Expectancy with Deployment

**Objective:**  
This project aims to analyze global life expectancy trends and develop a machine learning model to predict life expectancy based on a range of socioeconomic and health indicators. The project covers the entire data science pipelineâ€”from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building, evaluation, and eventual cloud deployment using Streamlit.

**Scope:**  
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
  Address missing values, standardize column names, and ensure correct data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Visualize trends and relationships among variables to understand factors influencing life expectancy.
- **Modeling:**  
  Build and compare multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to predict life expectancy.
- **Deployment:**  
  Create an interactive web application using Streamlit to deploy the best performing model, allowing users to input feature values and obtain life expectancy predictions.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project provides country-level health and socioeconomic indicators, which serve as predictors for life expectancy. Each row represents a country-year observation with multiple variables that describe various dimensions of health and social development.

### Key Variables and Their Descriptions

- **Status:**  
  Indicates whether a country is classified as "Developed" or "Developing." This categorical variable often reflects differences in healthcare, economic stability, and infrastructure.

- **Adult Mortality:**  
  The number of adult deaths per 1,000 individuals. This variable is a key indicator of overall health conditions and healthcare quality.

- **Infant Deaths:**  
  The number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births. High infant mortality rates are typically associated with inadequate healthcare services and poor living conditions.

- **Alcohol:**  
  Per capita alcohol consumption, which can have significant effects on public health, including life expectancy.

- **Percentage Expenditure:**  
  The percentage of GDP that a country spends on health expenditure. This provides insight into the level of investment in public health.

- **Hepatitis B:**  
  Vaccination coverage for Hepatitis B, reflecting preventive healthcare measures in place.

- **Measles:**  
  Number of reported measles cases, which can indicate the strength of public health systems and vaccination programs.

- **BMI (Body Mass Index):**  
  A measure used to evaluate whether a population has a healthy weight, which is linked to overall health and longevity.

- **Under-Five Deaths:**  
  The number of deaths among children under the age of five. Similar to infant deaths, this variable highlights the effectiveness of maternal and child healthcare.

- **Polio:**  
  Vaccination coverage for polio, serving as an indicator of a country's immunization efforts.

- **Total Expenditure:**  
  Total health expenditure per capita, providing a broader picture of investment in healthcare services.

- **Diphtheria:**  
  Vaccination coverage for diphtheria, another marker of preventive healthcare practices.

- **HIV/AIDS:**  
  Prevalence of HIV/AIDS, an important health variable that can significantly impact life expectancy.

- **GDP:**  
  Gross Domestic Product, reflecting the economic strength of a country. Economic resources often correlate with better healthcare and longer life expectancy.

- **Population:**  
  The total population of the country, which can sometimes influence the availability and quality of healthcare services.

- **Thinness (1-19 years) and Thinness (5-9 years):**  
  Indicators of malnutrition in children and adolescents, which can affect overall health and development.

- **Income Composition:**  
  A composite measure representing the income distribution within a country. Income inequality can have substantial implications for public health.

- **Schooling:**  
  Average years of schooling, a proxy for the level of education in a population. Higher education levels often correlate with better health awareness and outcomes.

- **Year:**  
  The year when the data was collected. In this project, the year is one-hot encoded into separate binary columns (e.g., `Year_2001`, `Year_2002`, ..., `Year_2015`) to capture temporal trends without implying an ordinal relationship.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Imputation:**  
   The project begins with cleaning the dataset by standardizing column names, converting data types, and imputing missing values both at the country level and overall using mean imputation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Various plots (histograms, heatmaps, violin plots, and line charts) are used to understand the distribution of life expectancy and the relationships among the predictor variables.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Categorical variables such as **Status** are encoded.
   - The **Year** variable is transformed into multiple binary columns via one-hot encoding.
   - Other numeric variables are standardized to ensure that models perform optimally.

4. **Model Development:**  
   Multiple regression models, including Random Forest (the primary model), are trained to predict life expectancy. Their performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

5. **Deployment:**  
   The final model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing end-users to interact with the model by inputting various health and socioeconomic indicators and receiving life expectancy predictions in real time.
