# Project Overview

**Title:**  
A Comprehensive Analysis and Machine Learning Prediction of Life Expectancy with Deployment

**Objective:**  
This project aims to analyze global life expectancy trends and develop a machine learning model to predict life expectancy based on a range of socioeconomic and health indicators. The project covers the entire data science pipelineâ€”from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building, evaluation, and eventual cloud deployment using Streamlit.

**Scope:**  
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Address missing values, standardize column names, and ensure correct data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends and relationships among variables to understand factors influencing life expectancy.
- **Modeling:** Build and compare multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to predict life expectancy.
- **Deployment:** Create an interactive web application using Streamlit to deploy the best performing model, allowing users to input feature values and obtain life expectancy predictions.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project provides country-level health and socioeconomic indicators, which serve as predictors for life expectancy. Each row represents a country-year observation with multiple variables that describe various dimensions of health and social development.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Imputation:** The project begins with cleaning the dataset by standardizing column names, converting data types, and imputing missing values both at the country level and overall using mean imputation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Various plots (histograms, heatmaps, violin plots, and line charts) are used to understand the distribution of life expectancy and the relationships among the predictor variables.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Categorical variables such as **Status** are encoded. The **Year** variable is transformed into multiple binary columns via one-hot encoding. Other numeric variables are standardized to ensure that models perform optimally.

4. **Model Development:** Multiple regression models, including Random Forest (the primary model), are trained to predict life expectancy. Their performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

5. **Deployment:** The final model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing end-users to interact with the model by inputting various health and socioeconomic indicators and receiving life expectancy predictions in real time.
